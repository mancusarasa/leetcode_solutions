Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each
integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only
constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
